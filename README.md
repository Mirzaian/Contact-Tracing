## About
This project is about a 'Contact-Tracing' application for private or commerical use.


Here's why:
* Since the last few years have made our lives difficult, I have decided to program a simple contact tracking application.
* For the environment, to save paper
* To help newbies :smile:

Of course, there are many ways to program and visualize contact-tracing so I decided to make it very simple so that it is easy to understand what I did there.

### Built With

This project was created in Android studio with the programming language Kotlin.</br>
All used icons are from Android studio. I used gradle version 7.1.2 and SDK version 32 to realize it and for testing, primarily a pixel 5 with the currently latest android version 12 was used. You also need the desired Java version.

* [Kotlin.kt](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [ANDROID STUDIO](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [jdk.java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

## Getting Started

Here is a short introduction how to install and develop the application on a linux operating system by yourself.


### Prerequisites

Install desired Java version. For example in this case we will go with Java openjdk-11-jdk.
* Step 1
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
  ```
  
  Now, installation of Android Studio by using the snap command.
  * Step 2
  ```sh
  $ sudo snap install android-studio --classic
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Now we start the Android Studio using the bellow command.
   ```sh
   $ android-studio
   ```
2. In the next step, we clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RazamTV/Contact-Tracking.git
   ```
3. Now you have the project on your computer. In Android studio you have on the top the option `File`, click that. Now choose `Open` and select the folder of the application
